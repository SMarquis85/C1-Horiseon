# C1-Horiseon

## Main Task

To refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Requirements: 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accesibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Final Review

Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. This action was applied to both 
html and css. Looks cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. Comments were
added in css to show where a few changes have been made.

By looking at the picture below, it is easy to identify the reason as to WHY the link is not 
functioning properly on the website.
